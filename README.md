# rl4analog

RL4Analog is a light-weight wrapper of an RL optimizer over the Spectre Analog simulator. It assumes that Spectre is installed and that the PDKs are also in the correct path.

There are a number of benchmark analog circuits available to optimize for using RL. Circuit1 is a 2 stage voltage amplifier, and TIA is a two-stage transimpedance amplifier.
